Hello, I'm Jongeun Baek.

My research focuses on building reliable language models. I currently work in Mechanistic Interpretability in Large Language Models and Explainable AI, pursuing the long-term goal of an AI assistant that can explain knowledge across domains in a trustworthy manner. 

I am a Masterâ€™s student in the *Statistical Artificial Intelligence Lab* ([SAIL](https://sailab.kaist.ac.kr/)) at [KAIST]((https://gsai.kaist.ac.kr)), advised by Prof. Jaesik Choi. Previously, I studied [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.postech.ac.kr) at [POSTECH](https://postech.ac.kr).
